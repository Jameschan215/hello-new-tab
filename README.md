# Hello New Tab
#### Video Demo: 
#### Description: 
The project is a chrome extension which uses the "chrome_url_overrides" manifest key by replacing the user's default new tab page with a new html file. 

The new tab page can display a random photo from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), realtime weather from [tomorrow](https://www.tomorrow.io/), and a random quote from [quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).
